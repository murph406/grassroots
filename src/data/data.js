The platform’s objective: to help social workers track which services are received by children in child welfare, foster care and homeless systems, and then compare performance results between providers.",

After implementing this system with providers, the wait time was reduced to less than 24 hours, and the administrative time spent on visits was reduced by about 30%. “No-shows” from parents were also reduced by over 20%, reducing the costs of visitation—and improving its likelihood.",

We worked with the state to condense the amount of information Therapists were being asked to provide, to only the essential data points informing outcomes and case related activities. Data from these assessments is then referenced in visitation, monthly reporting and end of service reporting, pre-filling form fields. No double data entry, ever.",
